\usage{
getLayer(var, iso3 = "SSA", by = NULL, collapse = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{character array of variable names (all types are accepted)}

\item{iso3}{optional country or regional filter (3-letter code)}

\item{by}{optional character array of variables to group by (all types are accepted)}

\item{collapse}{if FALSE always return all pixel values (useful for plotting and spatial formats)}
}
\value{
a data.table of \code{var} indicators aggregated by \code{by}
}
\description{
Workhorse method to subset and/or aggregate HarvestChoice layers.
This method also aggregates classified variables by continuous variables.
e.g. \code{getLayer(var=c("whea_h", "AEZ16_CLAS"), by=c("ADM2_NAME_ALT", "bmi"))}.
It does so by returning the dominant class of a classified variable within each \code{by}
class, and by automatically classifying any continuous variable passed to \code{by}
using value breaks specified as part of each variable metadata.
The formula used to aggregate classified variables by choosing the dominant class is
\code{names(sort(table({varCode}), decreasing=T)[1])}. This formula computes the
frequency of each class, ranks them by decreasing frequency, and retains the top one.
